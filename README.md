# **Game Off 2019 Game**

How to play :

* The goal of the game is to reach the goal (which is a ripple effect for now)

* Move with A and D keyboard keys

* Jump with Space

* Hold C to switch the camera's mode, Arrows to move the camera's frame

* If you hold it for too long, you will run out of battery's charge!

* You can fill the battery again with the batteries that spawn on the map

If you will play the Webgl's version : PLEASE PLAY IN FULL SCREEN!

This isn't really a full game, it's more of a demo/proof of concept so it's far from finished but enjoy!
